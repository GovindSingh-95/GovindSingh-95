### Hi, I'm Govind 👋

I'm a full-stack developer and third-year CSE student (B.Tech, 2027) focused on building production-grade tools, platforms, and utilities — often independently, end to end.

Right now, I’m developing **SwiftKart** — a Blinkit-style grocery delivery platform built solo as a Software Development Intern at Brisons International. From frontend UI to backend architecture (cart, checkout, inventory), it's designed as a mobile-first PWA optimized for real-world use.

Earlier, I single-handedly built **Avaxan Pharma**, a pharmacy e-commerce platform during my internship at Avaxan. It includes secure product flows, clean backend structure, and an AI-powered chatbot (currently being integrated).

Some of my favorite personal projects:
- ⚙️ [**Zephyr Dev Tools**](https://encr.pw/IIyPo) – modern all-in-one dashboard for developers  
- 🔐 [**Diffie-Hellman Demo**](https://l1nq.com/Y7FZ0) – interactive cryptography visualizer  
- ✍️ [**RSA Digital Signature + Blockchain Timestamping**](https://l1nq.com/TTapp) – secure document signing  
- 🎮 [**PokéNest**](https://l1nq.com/0GrPp) – stat calculator, team builder, and battle tools for Pokémon fans  
- 🧠 **FocusNet** – productivity tracker for devs & students  
- 🎲 **GameHub** – collection of classic games with AI logic (Tetris, Snake, 2048, Ping Pong, etc.)

Outside of dev, I’ve solved 400+ problems on LeetCode, contribute actively in <CODE/IO> and ACM, and constantly experiment with new tech and tools.

> Fun fact: I was invited to the **Pokémon World Championship 2025**, where I learned that strategy, timing, and good decision-making matter both in battles and in code 😄
