 <h2>Hello World</h2>
  <h3> I am Govind Singh,currently persuing my Btech from BMS College of Engineering,Bengluru.</h3>
  <h3>My GitHub profile serves as a platform where I showcase my dedication to coding and problem-solving. It includes solo projects that demonstrate my ability to independently build solutions from scratch, along with repositories where I share insights on tricky algorithmic questions. I go beyond simply providing solutions by explaining the underlying algorithms in detail, making the concepts accessible to others. This practice not only reinforces my own understanding but also contributes to the learning community. Through my GitHub, I aim to document my coding journey, share knowledge, and inspire collaboration with other developers.</h3>
