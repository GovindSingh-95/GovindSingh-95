### Hi, I'm Govind 👋

I'm a full-stack developer and third-year CSE student (B.Tech, 2027) who enjoys building production-grade tools, platforms, and web applications — usually solo, end to end.

Currently, I’m developing **Fetchly** as a Software Development Intern at Brisons International — a full-featured grocery delivery platform with real-time product browsing, cart and checkout flows, and a scalable backend. It’s built using the MERN stack and designed as a mobile-first PWA.

Previously, I single-handedly built **Avaxan Pharma**, a pharmacy e-commerce platform during my internship. It features secure authentication, product flows, and an AI chatbot integrated.

Some personal projects I’ve worked on:
- 🔐 [**Diffie-Hellman Demo**](https://l1nq.com/Y7FZ0) – interactive cryptography visualizer  
- ✍️ [**RSA Signature + Blockchain Timestamping**](https://l1nq.com/TTapp) – secure document signing app  
- ⚙️ [**Zephyr Dev Tools**](https://encr.pw/IIyPo) – modern utility dashboard for developers  
- 🌦️ [**WeatherMood**](https://sunny-side-up-quotes.lovable.app) – playful weather app with mood-based UI  
- 🧠 [**FocusNet**](https://spark-your-day-hub.lovable.app) – a lightweight productivity tracker  
- 🎮 [**PokéNest**](https://l1nq.com/0GrPp) – tools for Pokémon team building, stat analysis, and simulation  
- 🎲 **GameHub** – AI-enhanced Tetris, Snake, 2048, Ping Pong, and more

I’ve solved 400+ problems on LeetCode, and I’m actively involved in <CODE/IO>,TeamCodeLocked and ACM. I love exploring new stacks, building fast UIs, and solving meaningful problems.

> Fun fact: I was invited to the **Pokémon World Championship 2025** — a great reminder that strategic thinking, pattern recognition, and good timing matter just as much in games as in software.
